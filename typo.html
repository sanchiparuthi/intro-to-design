        <h1> Typography :</h1>
        <h2>KOREA</h2>
        <br> 
        <p>Korean typography has a rich history and unique characteristics that have evolved alongside the development of character design. Below is a more detailed explanation of the history, current status, and features of Korean typography.
        </p> <br>
        <p>The Korean script, Hangul, was created in the early 15th century during the Joseon Dynasty by King Sejong the Great (1418–1450). Motivated by the difficulty of using Chinese characters for the Korean populace, particularly for the commoners, King Sejong aimed to create a script that was easy to read and write. He recognized the need for a writing system that would be accessible to all citizens. Additionally, the complexity of accurately representing the various pronunciations of Korean using Chinese characters prompted King Sejong to seek a solution, leading to the creation of Hangul.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>During the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897), the design of Korean characters continued to evolve. Calligraphy and artistic expression, known as "글씨놀이" (writing play), flourished, reaching a high level of artistic sophistication, particularly with the use of "금자" (metal type) in combination with calligraphy.
