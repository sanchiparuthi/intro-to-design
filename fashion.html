        <h2>KOREA</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hanbok translates to ‘korean clothes’  and was coined in the late 19th century as a way to differentiate between korean clothing and the increasingly popular western attire. What was once everyday clothing, is now regarded as traditional ceremonial clothing in Korea that is reserved for holidays, celebrations, and events.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is traditional attire that was made with cotton, silk, hemp, raime, and other materials, depending on the seasons.</p> <br>

        <p>A hanbok contains three main parts: the jeogori (저고리) which is the long sleeve top, a skirt/ trousers, and the durumagi (두루마기) which is the outerwear. The jeogori had many variations depending on the time period. For example, during the Three Kingdom period, the jeogori could be fastened using belts. Then the 6th century saw a left-to right frontal fold which became the typical design for future hanbok. The styles of hanbok would change based on regional powers. The hanbok continued to change until the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) which most closely resembles the modern day hanbok</p> <br>
        <p>While much of western clothing is based on the process of draping and fittings on a mannequin, the hanbok is cut and sewn on a flat surface. This is beneficial for reducing the amount of textile waste. In addition, any remaining fabric is used to create the colored stripes of the hanbok called saekdong (색동) or jogakbo (조각보). Saekdong translates to colorful stripes. The long colorful strips are symbolic of wishing the wearer a long and happy life. Jogakbo is a korean patchwork style. It is made of scrap pieces of fabric that are carefully and meticulously stitched together. It is an incredibly time-consuming craft in fact, much of the remaining jogakbo today lacks wear and tear attesting to their preciousness.</p> <br>
        <p>Different versions of the hanbok of the Joseon Dynasty signified gender, social class, marital status, and age. For example, the white jeogori and the blue skirt were often worn by married women. Furthermore, women of a higher class would wear an undyed white ramie jacket and undergarments with an indigo dyed ramie skirt. </p> <br>
